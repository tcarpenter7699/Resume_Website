                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>I started in Fall 2018.</li>
                    <li>I began majoring in Pre-Med.</li>
                    <li>I was part of the newly formed MSA(Med School Admit) Program the year it was created.</li>
                    <li>As I got into the higher level courses, I began to struggle to maintain interest in the broadness of the field.</li>
                    <li>I changed my major to Kinesiology focusing on the field of PT to give myself a more directed focus.</li>
                    <li>I consistently earned As and Bs in most of my courses.</li>
                    <li>I enjoyed the material but as the courses started stressing the importance of people skills, I started to question my future.</li>
                    <li>While working at Intralot doing 12 hour night shifts, I also was a full time student.</li>
                    <li>This often meant going to school straight after work and getting maybe 3 hours of sleep a day if I was lucky.</li>
                    <li>During this period is when I developed my work ethic and drive to succeed.</li>
                    <li>I finished out my degree while still learning my duties at Intralot far faster than what was expected and proved to be a consistent, reliable employee capable of leading by example and helping my coworkers if problems arose.</li>
                    <li>After I graduated, I focused on my job at Intralot while looking into what I could do in the future as I knew I needed more income and was capable of more.</li>
                    <li>I learned about this company through my relationship with Dale Engelhorn and inquired if it was something I could do if I wanted to even without a related degree.</li>
                    <li>In between shifts when I had time, I started to learn the basics I would need to make this website to present as a resume.</li>
                    <li>I look forward to learning more and increasing my capabilities and proficiencies.</li>
                </ul>
